# Enhanced Features
This fork adds a number of quality-of-life features on top of Pico Launcher. This document describes each of them.

## Controls
These controls are available in the rom browser, on top of the standard ones (see [Usage](Usage.md)):

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| L / R | Jump to the previous or next initial (see [Jumping by initial](#jumping-by-initial)) |
| X (short press) | Toggle favorite for the highlighted game |
| X (hold ~half a second) | Toggle completed for the highlighted game |
| SELECT + A | Launch a random game from the current folder |
| START (hold ~half a second) | Save a screenshot of both screens (see [Screenshots](#screenshots)) |
| Right arrow (display settings) | Open the menu: recently played, favorites, statistics, delete game and the two filters (see [The menu](#the-menu)) |
| Light row (display settings) | Set the DS Lite backlight level (4 levels) |
| Folder button (display settings) | Toggle hiding empty folders |

## The menu
The app bar has back and display settings. Open display settings and use the right arrow to move to the menu page. It lists: **Recently played**, **Favorites**, **Statistics** and **Delete game** in two columns, and under them the two filters, **Only favorites** and **Only completed**, each saying `on` or `off`. Tap an entry, or highlight it with the d-pad and press A. Picking a panel closes the menu and opens the panel in its place; a filter applies at once and closes the menu. B, or a tap outside the sheet, returns to display settings. No app bar button hides a second action behind a hold any more; the X and START holds in the table above are unchanged.

The small button at the right of the menu's title opens the **about** sheet: Pico Launcher by the LNH team on one side, Enhanced by rasalopa on the other, then the version with the commit it was built from and the repository the build came from, and a cheat sheet of the controls that have no button of their own, three at a time; up and down scroll it. A build made from another repository names that repository there, so you can always tell where a build came from.

## Jumping by initial
In a folder with hundreds of games, paging through the list a screen at a time takes a
while. L and R now jump to where the previous or next initial starts, so crossing a large
folder takes a few presses instead of dozens.

R moves to the first game filed under the next initial. L moves to the top of the current
initial, and again to the top of the one before it, so getting back to the start of a long
run of games sharing an initial does not need a detour.

As you jump, the initial you landed on shows for a moment at the bottom of the touch screen,
the same way the screenshot message does, so it stays easy to see where you are without
watching the list.

Folders and games are stepped through separately, since folders are always listed first.
Games are grouped by the first character of their file name, which is what the list is
sorted by, so the jump always follows the order on screen. This means a game whose file
name starts with an article or a number is filed under that, not under its title.

L and R keep paging in the cheats, favorites and recently played lists.

## Favorites
Press X on a highlighted game to mark it as a favorite (press again to unmark). Favorites show a small heart on the top screen when highlighted. The mark belongs to that ROM **file**: moving it to another folder keeps it, renaming it starts over, and a second copy of the same game is marked separately. See [Data storage](#data-storage) if a mark is not where you expect it.

## Favorites panel
**Favorites** in the menu opens a panel listing your favorites from **every** folder, alphabetically, each with its total play time, handy when the collection is spread across many folders. Tap an entry (or highlight it and press A) to jump to that game's folder with the game preselected; press B to close.

Favorites marked before this feature existed appear in the panel after you toggle them again or launch them once (the panel needs the game's stored path). An entry whose file has moved or is gone still appears, but selecting it does nothing instead of jumping to the card root; re-mark or launch the game from its new location to update it.

## Completed games
Hold X on a highlighted game for about half a second to mark it as completed (hold again to unmark). Completed games show a small green check on the top screen when highlighted, next to the heart. Like favorites, the mark belongs to the ROM file.

## Favorites and completed filters
**Only favorites** in the menu filters the browser down to favorites, and **Only completed** to completed games. Each row says `on` while its filter is active, in red and green, and the browser behind it updates as soon as the menu closes. With both filters on, only games that are favorite *and* completed remain. The filters apply per folder, and folders themselves always stay visible.

Marks, play counts and play time all belong to the ROM file, so what the top screen shows and what the filter matches are always the same thing (see [GameData.md](GameData.md)). Two copies of a game are marked separately, and a ROM hack no longer inherits its base game's mark. Renaming a ROM outside the launcher starts it over, and games whose file name is longer than 96 bytes cannot be marked at all (accented characters count double).

## Random game
Hold SELECT and press A to launch a random game from the folder you are currently viewing. With the favorites filter active, it picks a random favorite. SELECT on its own does nothing, so the DSi brightness shortcut (SELECT + volume) stays free.

## DSi-only games on a DS
On a DS or DS Lite, a game made for the DSi only cannot run: the console never enters DSi mode, and launching it ends in a white screen. The launcher now checks the game's own header when you press A and, if the game is DSi-only, stays where it is and says `Needs a DSi or 3DS` at the bottom of the screen. DSiWare titles count as DSi-only too. On a DSi or 3DS nothing changes.

## Launch tracking and play time
Every launch is recorded automatically, unless you switch that off (see below). The launch count and play time used to show at the top-right of the top screen (`3x 2h05`, or `3x · 16 Jul` before any play time was recorded); that text is switched off in this version because the play time overstates, as explained below. The data is still kept. The favorite heart and the completed check now sit above the game's icon, astride the card's edge, where a gold star also marks the most launched game, the one that heads the statistics panel.

Play time is approximate: a session starts when a game is launched and ends the next time the launcher boots. Because of that:
- Sessions longer than 6 hours are discarded: that was a power-off, not a play session.
- Time spent in sleep mode counts as play time.
- A session is lost if the console is powered off without booting back into the launcher.

If you would rather the launcher kept no record of your launches, set `"launchTracking": false` in `settings.json` (see [Usage.md](/docs/Usage.md#settings)). Launching a game then writes nothing to the game data: no launch count, no play time, no last played date. (The launcher still remembers the last game you launched, as it always did, so it can highlight it on the next boot.) The recently played list, the statistics panel and the star of the most launched game keep showing what was recorded before, and favorites and completed marks keep working.

## Recently played
**Recently played** in the menu opens a list of up to 20 recently played games, most recent first, each with the date and time it was last played. Tap an entry (or highlight it and press A) to jump to that game's folder with the game preselected. Press B to close the panel.

## Statistics
**Statistics** in the menu opens a summary panel: a row of four figures with an icon each (games in the folder you are in, played, favorites, completed), your three most launched games with their counts, and the last game you played with its date and time. File names show without their extension there. The launcher's version sits at the top-right of the panel. The version with the commit it was built from shows on the bottom screen while the launcher boots, and in the about sheet, for when you report something and need to say which build you have. The total launches and play time line is switched off in this version, for the reason given above. Press B to close it.

## Screenshots
Hold START for about half a second to save both screens to `/_pico/screenshots` on your SD card, as BMP files.

Each hold writes two files that share a number: `shotNNN_bot.bmp` for the bottom screen and `shotNNN_top.bmp` for the top one. The number is the lowest one neither screen has taken yet, so a pair is always the two halves of one press. Up to 1000 pairs fit in the folder.

A short message appears at the bottom of the lower screen once the files are on the card. It confirms the write rather than the button press, so if something goes wrong (a full folder, a card that cannot be written to) it tells you it could not save instead; the reason only goes to the log. Holding START again while the previous pair is still being written shows `Still saving the last one`; wait a moment and try again.

A few things worth knowing:
- The two screens are recorded a couple of frames apart. The console can only capture one screen at a time, so during a fast animation the two halves of a pair will not match exactly.
- The screen flashes while the picture is taken. That is the capture, not a fault.
- The shortcut works in the file browser and in every panel that opens over it (the menu, display settings, cheats, favorites, recently played, statistics, delete confirmation). It does not work in the theme selector, which is a separate screen with its own input handling.
- The hold has to begin while the launcher is running, so a button that was already held down when it started is not read as a request.

## Deleting games
**Delete game** in the menu deletes the highlighted game; the entry is faded while a folder is highlighted. A confirmation sheet opens first: press **X** to confirm, or A or B to cancel. Only games can be deleted, not folders.

Deleting a game also deletes its save file (same name with a `.sav` extension, next to the ROM) and removes the game's entry from `gamedata.json`. Note that saves are matched by name without the extension: if `Game.gba` and `Game.nds` sit in the same folder, they share `Game.sav`, and deleting either game deletes it. With `saveLocation` set to `saves` (see [Usage.md](/docs/Usage.md#settings)), deleting a DS game deletes its save in the `saves` folder when there is one, and a save still next to the ROM is then left alone. When the folder has none, because the game was not launched since the setting was turned on, the save next to the ROM is deleted as before. The confirmation names the file that will go.

## Deleting themes
*Coming in the next release; v1.9.0 and earlier don't have it.*

In the theme selector, the trash button at the bottom of the app bar deletes the highlighted theme's folder, with everything in it. A confirmation sheet opens first, naming the theme and its folder, since two themes can share a name: press **X** to confirm, or A or B to cancel. The selector then starts again without it, on the theme that took its place.

The theme you are using and the two that come with the launcher, `material` and `raspberry`, can't be deleted; the button is faded on them. A folder whose `theme.json` can't be read shows under its folder name and can be deleted too. Nothing is deleted when a file in the folder is read-only, when it has more than four levels of folders or 1024 files and folders, when a name can't be read back, or when the card looks damaged around it; the sheet says why, and the folder can still be deleted on a computer. The theme's `theme.json` goes first, so if a delete is cut short, what is left shows as a folder name and can be deleted again.

## Cheats
The cheat list wraps around at both ends: pressing up on the first entry jumps to the last
one, and pressing down on the last entry comes back to the first, so the bottom of a long
cheat database is one press away from the top. Inside a sub-category, pressing up from the
first entry still moves to the back button, as before; the wrap happens where there is
nothing above the list to move to.

The sheet also shows a small `X: all off` hint next to the cheat description while cheats
are listed. Pressing X disables every cheat at once. The launcher supported this already,
but nothing on screen said so. Handy to make sure no code is active before going online or
starting a speedrun.

## Display settings
The gear opens layout and sorting choices you can swipe horizontally. Their selected names appear in blue, and English and Español language chips sit below. The normal cover flow remains available; inverted cover flow was removed. The right arrow opens the menu page. A folder button in the title row toggles empty folders.

## Screen brightness (DS Lite)
On a DS Lite, the display settings sheet has a **Light** row with four backlight levels. Tapping a level applies it immediately, and the choice is remembered and restored on every boot. It also stays active inside the game you launch, until the console powers off.

Until you pick a level the launcher leaves the firmware's brightness untouched. On an original DS, a DSi, or a 3DS running the launcher from a DSpico, the row is not shown: the original DS has no brightness levels, and the DSi and 3DS set brightness from their own system menu.

## Hide empty folders
The display settings sheet has a folder button in its title row that hides folders containing no visible games, homebrew or media of their own (banner, BGM and other system files don't count as content). It's off by default; toggling it refreshes the folder you're currently viewing immediately. While it is on, its circle takes the same color as the chosen options below it.

Subfolders are followed a few levels deep, so a folder containing only other empty folders is hidden too. Launcher support folders (names starting with `_`) are always kept.

Emptiness means "has nothing in it", independently of the favorites and completed filters. With one of those filters on you can therefore still see a folder that turns out to hold nothing matching it. Checking the filters here meant reading every ROM in every folder on each navigation, which was slow enough that folders started reappearing.

## Per-folder music
Place a `bgm.bcstm` file directly inside a folder to give it its own background music. It uses the same DSP-ADPCM `.bcstm` format as theme music (see [Themes](Themes.md)) and supports looping. The music starts when you enter the folder and switches back to the theme music when you leave. Each folder is checked independently: subfolders do not inherit their parent's music.

The `bgm.bcstm` file itself is not shown in the rom browser (file extensions without an association are hidden).

## Time-of-day theme backgrounds
Custom themes can provide night variants of their backgrounds: place `topbg_night.bin` and/or `bottombg_night.bin` next to `topbg.bin` and `bottombg.bin` in the theme folder (same 256x192, 15 bpp format). Between 20:00 and 6:59 the night variants are used when present. The time is checked when the launcher starts. Delete the `_night` files to disable the effect.

`tools/make_night_bg.py` can generate night variants from a theme's existing backgrounds; see [Tools.md](Tools.md).

## Data storage
Favorites, completed marks, launch counts, play time and the recents list are all stored in a single file, `/_pico/gamedata.json`, written by the launcher itself. Saves are atomic, and if the file ever fails to parse the launcher refuses to overwrite it rather than starting over. Deleting the file resets all favorites and statistics.

**Each entry belongs to one ROM file, identified by its file name.** That single rule explains most surprises:

| What you see | Why |
|---|---|
| A game lost its heart and its play time | The file was renamed outside the launcher. The launcher sees a different file, so it starts over. The old entry stays in the file, unused |
| The same game in two folders has separate favorites | They are two files. Marking one does not mark the other |
| A ROM hack does not inherit the base game's marks | Same reason: different files, even though they share an internal game code |
| Two copies with the *same* file name share one entry | The name is the identity, so same name means same entry. Deleting one through the launcher removes the entry both were using |
| Pressing X does nothing on some game | Its file name is longer than 96 bytes, which cannot be stored (accented characters count as two). The launcher logs it |
| A favorite is missing from the favorites panel | The panel only lists entries with a stored path. Marks made before that existed get one the next time you launch or re-mark the game. Entries whose file has moved or is gone are still listed, but selecting them does nothing |

Earlier versions identified a game by its internal game code instead, which made a ROM hack and its base game share one entry, and could leave the browser filter and the top screen disagreeing about the same game.

The file format is documented in [GameData.md](GameData.md) for anyone writing external tools.
